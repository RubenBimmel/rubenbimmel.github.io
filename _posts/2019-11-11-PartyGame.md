In this tutorial I will teach you how to use html and js to create a online multiplayer game that can be played on smartphones. 

The game also features a shared screen that can be opened on a pc or tablet browser. The end result will be similar to the way jackbox games do their networking. Doing everything in the browser has a huge advantage for these kind of games because you can do everything in the same codebase.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

1. Node.js and Express
2. Basic controller
3. Basic receiver
4. Socket.io
5. Rooms
6. Gamemanager
7. Animations
8. Controls
9. UI

Each section builds on the content from the previous sections. You don't have to follow all of them. Every tutorial will start and end with a download link for the code so you can continue with the tutorial from any section.

### Setup

Developing this game requires a code editor that supports html and js. It does not matter which one you use. If you do not have any code editor yet I can highly recommend [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is a nice and lightweight code editor and is free to use!
