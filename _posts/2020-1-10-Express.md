The first node module we are going to install is called Express. This is a web framework that will help us to create a more advanced server.

This tutorial continues with the code from the previous part. You can get the finished code from the last part [here](https://github.com/RubenBimmel/MultiplayerGameTutorial/tree/master/01-NodeJS).

## Creating an express app
First we need to install Express in our project. Open your commandline tool again. Go to your project folder and run `npm install express`.

```
c:\> cd MultiplayerGame

c:\MultiplayerGame> npm install express
```

We can now replace our current server with one using the express app. Remove these lines:

```js
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!');
});
```

We are going to replace them with our new express server. Load the module inside `index.js` and create the app and server like this.

```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
```

Now if we go navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> we will see an error message showing `Cannot GET /`. This is because we are not listening to any http request anymore. We can now use express to open a html page when navigating to our server. Let's create an index file for our homepage. Add a file called `index.html` to our project folder. Then add the following lines of code to your `index.js`.

```js
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile('index.html', { root: __dirname })
});
```

Navigating to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> will now return us our newly created (empty) html page. Let's create 2 more pages. One for our shared screen and one for our controller. 

```js
app.get('/screen', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile('screen.html', { root: __dirname })
});

app.get('/controller', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile('controller.html', { root: __dirname })
});
```
