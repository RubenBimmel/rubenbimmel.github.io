In this first part we are going to create the server that will host our game.

A multiplayer game requires two components. A client (frontend) and a server (backend). The client is a webpage that runs in a browser. It is the visible part of the game. There will be multiple instances of the client for each browser screen that opens your webpage. The server is the code that runs on the machine that hosts your webpage. It has only one instance. In a multiplayer game this server is necessary to allow communication between the multiple clients.

If you are familiar with the basics of JavaScript you know that it is mostly used in the context of an HTML webpage. In this case it runs inside a browser on the client-side. NodeJS is an environment that runs on the server-side. It allows us to also use JavaScript on the server. In addition, NodeJS has a lot of modules that are very useful for creating multiplayer games. We will be adding these later in the tutorial.

## Hello World
The first step is to install NodeJS from the official site: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once installed, create a new folder for your game. Inside the folder create a file and open your command line tool. Navigate to the newly created folder and run the command `npm init`. On windows, this will look something like this.

```
c:\> cd MultiplayerGame

c:\MultiplayerGame> npm init
```

This will create a new node project. It will ask you some questions on how you want to initialize the project. You can use the defaults for all of these and skip through all of them by hitting enter.

Create a new file inside the folder and name it `index.js`. This will become the file that runs the server. Open the file in your code editor. Let's start with a very basic node setup.

Node has a built-in module for http. This module allows us to reach the server from a browser. Let's start with a simple Hello World example.

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!');
});
```

In order to connect to the server we need to assign it to a port. For now it is enough to do this on a local port. A common port to use for servers is 3000. Add the following lines to your code.

```js
const port = 3000;

server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at *:${port}`);
});
```

This allows you to run the server locally. Inside your command line tool (still in the projects root folder) run `node index.js`. 

```
c:\MultiplayerGame> node index.js
```

Now you should be able to reach your node server. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> inside your browser and you should get a webpage showing Hello World. In a later part of the tutorial we will replace this string with our games client.

To quit the server hit `ctrl + c` in the console. We need to restart our server every time we change something inside our project. To prevent this we can use a nodemon. This will automatically update the server after every change we make. Install the tool by running the following command:

```js
npm install -g nodemon
```

Instead of running `node index.js` we can now run the nodemon command.

```js
c:\MultiplayerGame> nodemon index.js
```

Now if we make any changes, like changing the `Hello World!` string into something else, the server will restart automatically!

## What's next

This is our very first step in creating a server. In the next part of this tutorial we will create a more advanced server using the Express module.
